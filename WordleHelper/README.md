# Wordle Helper
Was one of my projects during University.<br >
Have done many variations, but decided that this was the best suit for my portfolio as it solved Wordle the best.<br >
My solution calculates the frequency of each letter in the words.txt document, turning this frequency into a percentage of overall letters and then using this percentage to calculate how common the word is. The most common word is outputted to the console for the user to decide, along side several others.
